# Welcome to Remix!

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

You will be running two processes during development:

- The Miniflare server (miniflare is a local environment for Cloudflare Workers)
- The Remix development server

Both are started with one command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://127.0.0.1:8787](http://127.0.0.1:8787) and you should be ready to go!

If you want to check the production build, you can stop the dev server and run following commands:

```sh
npm run build
npm start
```

Then refresh the same URL in your browser (no live reload for production builds).

## Cloudflare Config

You need to create a [Clouflare API token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/). This token needs `Account.Account Analytics` permissions.

Once you have the token, and your Cloudflare account ID, you need to:

1. Specify both values in `.dev.vars`
2. Add both values as environment variables to your Cloudflare project's settings.

## Deployment

If you don't already have an account, then [create a cloudflare account here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and after verifying your email address with Cloudflare, go to your dashboard and set up your free custom Cloudflare Workers subdomain.

Once that's done, you should be able to deploy your app:

```sh
npm run deploy
```
